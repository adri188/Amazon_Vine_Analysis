# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

##Overview of the analysis: The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.
Purpose of the analysis is to  determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, youâ€™ll write a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.

##Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

1. How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there? 
For my dataset there were 170 vine reviews and 37840 non vine

2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
65 5 stars for Vine Reviews and 20612 for Non-Vine

3.What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
38% for Vine, 54.4% Non-Vine

Summary: Based on this data it doesn't look like there is a positivity biased on Vine Reviews. 
The majority of the reviews were Non- Vine, and even with big difference in sample data there is no evidence of bias .
